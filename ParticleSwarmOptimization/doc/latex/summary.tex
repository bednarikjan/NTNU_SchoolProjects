\section{Summary}
The aim of this project was to utilize the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to solve the two well known standard problems called Circle problem and Knapsack problem. It was discovered the results are mainly influenced by the setting of local and global attraction coefficients and also by the utilization of the weighed inertia influencing the particles' velocity.
