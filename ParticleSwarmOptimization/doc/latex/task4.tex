\section{0-1 knapsack problem with volume extension}
In the last task the objective was to solve the adjusted Knapsack problem, where the knapsack is limited both by weight and volume limit. The Figure \ref{fig:knaspack_volume} shows the result of the algorithm terminating after 1000 iterations. It can be seen that after approximately 600 iterations the fitness function value does not change significantly.
