\section{Introduction}
This report describes the implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm which can be utilized to solve various types of problems. In this case two standard problems will be solved using swarm intelligence -- Circle problems for both one and two dimensions and Knapsack problem.

The core part of the report is divided into four sections reflecting the single tasks of the assignment Particle Swarm Optimization introduced in course IT3105 - Artificial Intelligence Programming.
